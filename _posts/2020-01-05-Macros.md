## Macros: The Key Points

<br/>

Macros let the programmers to add their own synatactic sugar to the syntax of a
language. A **macro definition** introduces some new syntax into the language. It 
describes how to transform the new syntax into different syntax in the language
itself. A **macro system** is a language (or part of a larger languages) for 
defining macros. A **macro use** is just using one of the macros previously 
defined. The semantics of a macro use is to replace the macro use with the 
appropriate syntax as defined by the macro definition. This process
is often called **macro expansion** because it is common but not required that 
the syntactic transformation produces a larger amount of code.

<br/>


The key point is that macro expansion happens before anything else: before type-
checking, before compiling, before evaluation. Think of "expanding all the macros" as a pre-pass over your
entire program before anything else occurs. So macros get expanded everywhere, such as in function bodies,
both branches of conditionals, etc.

<br/>


### Macro examples in Racket:

<br/>

A macro so that programmers can write `(my-if e1 then e2 else e3)` where **my-if**, **then**, and **else**
are keywords and this macro-expands to `(if e1 e2 e3)`.

A macro so that programmers can write `(comment-out e1 e2)` and have it transform to `e2`, i.e., it is
a convenient way to take an expression e1 out of the program (replacing it with e2) without actually
deleting anything.

A macro so that programmers can write `(my-delay e)` and have it transform to `(mcons #f (lambda () e))`.
This is different from the my-delay function we defined earlier because the function required the caller
to pass in a thunk. Here the macro expansion does the thunk creation and the macro user should not
include an explicit thunk.


## Tokenization, Parenthesization, and Scope

<br/>


### _Tokenization_

<br/>

Let's consider a macro that, "replaces every use of head with car". In macro systems, that does not mean
some variable __headt__ would be rewritten as __cart__. So the implementation of macros has to at least understand
how a programming language's text is broken into tokens (i.e., words). This notion of tokens is different in
different languages. For example, _a-b_ would be three tokens in most languages (a variable, a subtraction,
and another variable), but is one token in Racket.

**In C**, "macro expand a to z",  _a-b_ would be _z-b_ where it is not token but **subtraction**.

<br/>


### _Parenthesization_

<br/>

In C or C++, if you have a macro

``` C
#define ADD(x,y) x+y
```
then ADD(1,2/3)*4 gets rewritten as __1 + 2 / 3 * 4__, which is not the same thing as
__(1 + 2/3)*4__. So in such languages, macro writers generally include lots of 
explicit parentheses in their macro definitions, e.g.,
``` C
#define ADD(x,y) ((x)+(y))
```
In Racket, macro expansion preserves the code structure so this issue is not 
a problem.

<br/>


### _Scope_

<br/>


In Racket local variables can shadow macros. Macro expansion don't happen when
creating variable bindings. If local bindings would not happen to shadow macros:

"macro expand head to car":
```scheme
(let  ([head 0] [car 1]) head) ;0
(let* ([head 0] [car 1]) head) ;0
```
Would become:
```scheme
(let  ([car 0] [car 1]) head) ;error / gives error because we are not allowed declare the same variable twice in the same let expression.
(let* ([car 0] [car 1]) head) ;0     / the output is 1 because second "car" is shadowing the first "car", but we meant to refer first "car" which has value "0"
```

This is why C/C++ convention is all-caps macros and non-all-caps for everything else

## Racket Macros With define-syntax

```scheme
;; a cosmetic macro -- adds then, else
(define-syntax my-if
   (syntax-rules (then else)
	[(my-if e1 then e2 else e3)
	 (if e1 e2 e3)]))

;  (my-if foo then bar else baz) -> (if foo bar baz)
```

* define-syntax is the special form for defining a macro

* my-if is the name of our macro. It adds my-if to the environment so that expressions of the form
  (my-if ...) will be macro-expanded according to the syntax rules in the rest of the macro definition.

* syntax-rules is a keyword

* The next parenthesized list (in this case (**then else**)) is a list of "keywords" for this macro, i.e., any
use of **then** or **else** in the body of my-if is just syntax whereas anything not in this list (and not
my-if itself) represents an arbitrary expression.

* The rest is a list of pairs: how my-if might be used and how it should be rewritten if it is used that
way.

* In this example, our list has only one option: my-if must be used in an expression of the form
(my-if e1 then e2 else e3) and that becomes (if e1 e2 e3).

```scheme
;; a macro to replace an expression with another one

(define-syntax comment-out
   (syntax-rules ()
	[(comment-out e1 e2) e2]))

;  (comment-out (car null) (+ 3 4)) -> (+ 3 4)

```
```scheme
;; A delay macro

(defie-syntax my-delay
	(syntax-rules ()
	[(my-delay e) (mcons #f (lambda () e))]))

(f (my-delay e))
```
